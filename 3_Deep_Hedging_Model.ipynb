    "# 3. Deep Hedging Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement and train a neural network that learns to hedge a European call option dynamically using simulated market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat this as a reinforcement learning-style problem, where the model (policy) observes the market, makes hedging decisions at each time step, and aims to replicate the option payoff as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“˜ 3.1 Neural Network Architecture Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by defining the architecture of the hedging model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network takes as input a **market state vector** at each time step and outputs a **hedging decision** â€” specifically, the amount of the underlying asset to hold (hedge ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_t = \\pi_\\theta(s_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $( s_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 )$ is the state at time $( t )$ (from our feature vector)\n",
    "- $( \\pi_\\theta )$ is the policy network (a neural net with parameters $( \\theta )$)\n",
    "- $( a_t )$ is the action: the number of units of the underlying asset to hold\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state $( s_t )$ includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalized Price**: $( S_t / S_0 )$\n",
    "2. **Time to Maturity**: $( (T - t)/T )$\n",
    "3. **Log Return**: $( \\log(S_t / S_{t-1}) )$\n",
    "4. **Simulated Volatility**: $( \\sigma_t )$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are taken from the training dataset constructed in Notebook 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simple feedforward (fully connected) neural network applied independently at each time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input layer**: 4 features\n",
    "- **Hidden layers**: 2â€“3 layers with ReLU activation\n",
    "- **Output layer**: 1 value per time step (hedge ratio)\n",
    "- **Output activation**: Linear (no constraint on hedge ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "This network learns a function from observed market conditions to trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Step Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We apply the network **separately at each time step**, treating each $( s_t )$ as independent.  \n",
    "This is sufficient for vanilla deep hedging and simplifies training compared to using an RNN or transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We now define the neural network and prepare it to learn a mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_t \\mapsto a_t \\quad \\text{for each time step } t \\in \\{0, \\ldots, T-1\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we simulate the portfolio evolution from these decisions and define the training objective based on hedging performance."
