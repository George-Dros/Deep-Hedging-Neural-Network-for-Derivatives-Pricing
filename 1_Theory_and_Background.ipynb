    "## ðŸ“˜ 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern finance, hedging refers to strategies that reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. Traditionally, this is done using models like Black-Scholes, which assume idealized market conditions â€” no transaction costs, continuous trading, and perfect liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, real markets are noisy, discontinuous, and contain frictions such as bid-ask spreads and slippage. In such settings, traditional analytic hedging methods underperform.  \n",
    "**Deep Hedging** replaces handcrafted formulas with neural networks that learn optimal hedging strategies from data, taking market imperfections into account.\n",
